SproutCore Framework (Endash extensions)

This is a framework for containing preliminary code developed by
Endash (Christopher Swasey) for the Sproutcore framework.

Current contains the following:

views/divided.js
	A base class implementing a view divided into an
	arbitrary number of panes, with optional divider
	views to resize the panes.
	
views/split.js
	An extension to DividedView implementing some
	additional functionality, particularly by overriding
	certain methods to keep the SplitView a constant size
	and to adjust the sizes of its panes as needed to keep
	the SplitView optimally laid out.
	
views/thumb.js
	A simple view which notifies its delegate of mouse
	events. Subclassed by DividedView to use as the dividers
	
mixins/thumb_delegate.js
	Delegate for ThumbView. Mixed into DividedView.

mixins/split_view_delegate.js
	Delegate for SplitView. Mixed into SplitView.
